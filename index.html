                    <p>A wonderful burger that shows what can result from thinking just a little bit differently.This is one of those burgers that you crave on a hot summer evening, and has an interesting kick to it. You bite into the crispy fries with a hit of smokey paprika and right there a perfect summer evening is immortalized forever. Choose best-quality lean meat you can.</p>

                    <h2>Roti And Vegetable</h2>
                    <p>This decidedly non-authentic recipe is a cross between doubles and a kathi roll. Grace Parisi folds Indian roti bread around a filling of zucchini, okra, chickpeas, tomato and spinach in a creamy, tangy, curried yogurt sauce.</p>

                    <p>Last month, Alex and I hopped on a plane to Italy, Croatia and Spain in search of culinary inspiration. Armed with a notebook, we set about to eat everything. Several pages of transatlantic flight later, weâ€™re trying to recreate our favorites in our home kitchen so you can taste them, too!</p>
